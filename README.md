## Setup

This project uses the Weather API to fetch historic weather data. To run this project, you will need to obtain your own API key from the Weather API.

### Steps:

1. Visit the [Weather API website](https://www.weatherapi.com/) and sign up for a free account to get your API key.

2. Create a new file in the project root directory named `config.py`.

3. Open the `config.py` file and add the following line:

    ```python
    WEATHER_API_KEY = 'your-api-key'
    ```

    Replace `'your-api-key'` with the API key you obtained from the Weather API.

4. Save and close the `config.py` file.

The `config.py` file is included in the `.gitignore` file, so it won't be committed to your GitHub repository. This prevents your API key from being exposed publicly.

Now you can run the `get_weather_api_data.py` script to fetch historic weather data.
