Metrics\n","\n","Here are some possible options:\n","- **Levenshtein distance**: Measures the number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, substitutions) required to change one word into the other. Useful for small variations in spelling. Try this neat visual calculator: [Levenshtein Distance Calculator](https://phiresky.github.io/levenshtein-demo/).\n","  - Example: “apple pie” and “apple pi” would have a small Levenshtein distance because only one character is different.\n","\n","- **Damerau-Levenshtein Distance**: Similar to Levenshtein Distance but also considers transpositions of two adjacent characters.\n","  - Example: “apple pie” and “appel pie” would have a small Damerau-Levenshtein distance due to the transposition of ‘p’ and ‘l’.\n","\n","- **Jaccard Similarity**: Measures the similarity between two sets by dividing the size of their intersection by the size of their union. It’s useful for identifying common words or terms.\n","  - Example: “apple pie” and “pie apple” would have a high Jaccard similarity because they contain the same words, despite the order.\n","\n","$$ Jaccard(U,V) = \\frac{|U \\cap V|}{|U \\cup V|} $$\n","\n","- **Cosine similarity**: Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors in a multi-dimensional space. For short texts, this can be implemented using term frequency (TF) vectors.\n","  - Example: Converts “apple pie” and “pie apple” into vectors and calculates the cosine of the angle between them, which will be close to 1 if they are similar.\n","\n","$$ Cosine(x,y) = \\frac{x \\cdot y}{|x||y|} $$\n","\n","- **TF-IDF with Cosine Similarity**: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) considers the importance of a word in a document relative to the entire corpus. Using TF-IDF vectors with cosine similarity helps in identifying similar texts based on the importance of terms.\n","  - Example: “apple pie recipe” and “recipe for apple pie” would have high similarity as TF-IDF captures the significance of words in the context.\n","\n","- **Word Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe)**: Word embeddings map words into continuous vector spaces where semantically similar words are close to each other. Average the embeddings of words in the short texts and then use cosine similarity.\n","  - Example: “apple pie” and “pie with apples” would have similar vector representations in an embedding space.\n","\n","\n","For short texts with slight differences, a combination of TF-IDF with Cosine Similarity and Jaccard Similarity is often effective.

This makes sense given that there is a lot of overlap in the names of the circuits as they use common words and roots of words (e.g., international, circuit, park ). This demonstrates that matching terms (words) between the texts are more critical than the frequency or order of words. Also, because terms are not repeated in the names of circuits, it is intuitive that term frequency would not add valuable information.
